# pArt
Make your own pixel art grid, with every pixel containing a string that can be defined by the user. Originally created as a language-teaching tool, but could have further applications.

## how2pArt
Populate pa_words.txt with words you wish to have in the grid, separated by a comma. Each line (max 9) corresponds to a type (color for example). These words are then shuffled within the grid in their available positions.

Populate pa_pixels.txt with digits from 0 to 9, separated by a comma (0 is an empty pixel, 1 -> 9 are the colors as defined above).

Once everything is prepared, run the python file (may not work when running the file directly, in that case try running it in a code editor).

# pArt
Make your own pixel art grid, with every pixel containing a string that can be defined by the user. Originally created as a language teaching tool, but could have further applications.

## how2pArt
Populate pa_words.txt with words you wish to have in the grid. Each line (max 4) corresponds to a type (color for example). These words are then shuffled within the grid in their available positions.
Populate pa_pixels.txt with digits from 0 to 4, separated by a space (0 is an empty pixel, 1 -> 4 are the colors as defined above).
Run the python file.
